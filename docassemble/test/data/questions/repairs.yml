question: | 
  That's great that you have a written contract. Is your tenancy less than 7 years or is it a periodic tenancy?   
yesno: sevenyears
under: |
  A periodic tenancy means that it rolls over on either a weekly or monthly basis and has no fixed end date. It doesn't necessarily have to have started as a periodic tenancy, but could have rolled over at the end of a fixed term contract.

  As your tenancy is longer than 7 years it sounds like you do not have any rights for repairs under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.
subquestion: |
  This means that you are likely to be responsible for those those repairs unless your tenancy agreement says otherwise.
