   At this point you have contacted your landlord and waited 14 days and also attempted to get help through the council. 
subquestion: |
  We recommend either filing a complaint with your local council if you were not happy with their decision and ask them to look at their decision once more. This could be helpful if you think that they did not give enough care to look at your porblem. However, you can also contact your nearest Citizens Advice as a next step.

  If the problem is affecting your health and you have not received an appropriate response from your landlord (explaining how or when they will fix the issue) within 14 days, we would recommend contacting the Environmental Health department at your local council.

 Have you attempted to contact the council?
