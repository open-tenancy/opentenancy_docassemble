      [BOLDCENTER] Summary of openTenancy Advice

      We would recommend that you contact the Environmental Health department at your local council since the mould is affecting your health and you have attempted to contact your landlord to have it fixed, as well as waited the necessary 14 days. 
      Even if you are responsible for the cause of the damp or mould, if it is affecting your health then your landlord still must ensure that it is fixed in an appropriate amount of time. 
      If you are not happy with the council's response, we would then recommend either filing a complaint with your local council if you were not happy with their decision and ask them to look at their decision once more. This could be helpful if you think that they did not give enough care to look at your porblem. However, you can also contact your nearest Citizen's Advice as a next step. 
      Finally, if you have a tenancy that started after 1 October 2015 then you would have protection against being evicted in response to your complaint to the council by your landlord. In addition, they cannot evict you in response to your repair request if they failed to issue an adequate response in 14 days. To be adequate, the response must be in writing and set out the action to be taken and a reasonable timetable for carrying out that action
