  tenancy agreement: |
    This is a contract between you and your landlord. A tenancy agreement can be written OR verbal. This means that you and your landlord both made arrangements to allow you to live at the property. 
  periodic tenancy: |
    A periodic tenancy means that it rolls over on either a weekly or monthly   basis and has no fixed end date. It doesn't necessarily have to have started as a periodic tenancy, but could have rolled over at the end of a fixed term contract.
